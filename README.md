## Expense Splitter

The Expense Splitter is an evolving project aimed at simplifying the process of dividing shared expenses among a group of participants. The plan includes making the calculator more generic and incorporating a user interface for enhanced usability.

### Motivation:
Motivation:
The idea came to mind as I attended a food night with four other friends from different fields at the same university. I somehow became the one to do the "simple" calculations for the expenses that night. As I have been actively working on side projects after school and holding a part-time job as a software trainee, almost automatically, a voice came into my mind: "Why shouldn't I automate this process using my programming skills?" So later in the night, after midnight, I started to code something...

### Todo
- [ ] Manage deletion of individual users and clear values.
- [ ] BUG fix, transition not applied to the input element.

### Planned Features:

1. **Generic Calculator:**
   - Refactor the code to make the expense calculator more generic, allowing it to handle a variety of shared expense scenarios.
   - Ensure flexibility to accommodate different types of expenses and varying numbers of participants.

2. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Design and implement a user-friendly interface to enhance the overall user experience.
   - Input fields for participant names and their respective payments.
   - Display total payment, average payment, and individual balances in a clear and understandable manner.

3. **Dynamic Balancing:**
   - Implement dynamic balancing algorithms to efficiently calculate how much each participant owes or is owed.
   - Enable real-time updates on the UI as participants are added or payments are adjusted.

4. **Decimal Precision:**
   - Address floating-point precision issues by handling money values in a more accurate manner, possibly using integer representations for cents.

5. **Transaction History:**
   - Include a transaction history or summary feature, providing users with a transparent record of how expenses were split.
